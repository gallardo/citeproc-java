<strong>Integrates [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/java/).</strong>

citeproc-java
=============

A [Citation Style Language (CSL)](http://citationstyles.org/) processor
for Java.

The library interprets CSL styles and generates citations and
bibliographies. In addition to that, citeproc-java contains a
[BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org/) converter that is able to map BibTeX
database entries to CSL citations.

The documentation is available at the following site:  
https://michel-kraemer.github.io/citeproc-java/

citeproc-js
-----------

The library includes [citeproc-js](https://bitbucket.org/fbennett/citeproc-js/wiki/Home),
a CSL processor written in JavaScript. citeproc-js has been created
by Frank G. Bennett and is licensed under the
[Common Public Attribution License Version 1.0](http://bitbucket.org/fbennett/citeproc-js/src/tip/LICENSE).

Name Parser
-----------

The BibTeX name parser's grammar is based on the one found
in the [bibtex-ruby](https://github.com/inukshuk/bibtex-ruby).
The original grammar is licensed under GPL v3. It has been
converted to ANTLR and is released here under the Apache License
2.0 by permission of the original author Sylvester Keil.

BibTeX Converter
----------------

The BibTeX to CSL converter is based on the mapping used in
[Docear](http://www.docear.org) as [presented by Joeran Beel](http://www.docear.org/2012/08/08/docear4word-mapping-bibtex-fields-and-types-with-the-citation-style-language).

Docear is released under the GPLv2 but its code
[may also be reused](http://www.docear.org/software/licence/)
in projects licensed under Apache License 2.0. The mapping is released here
under the Apache License 2.0 by permission of Joeran Beel, Docear.
