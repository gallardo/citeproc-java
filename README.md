Notes on used components
------------------------

### citeproc-js

The library includes [citeproc-js](https://bitbucket.org/fbennett/citeproc-js/wiki/Home),
a CSL processor written in JavaScript. citeproc-js has been created
by Frank G. Bennett and is licensed under the
[Common Public Attribution License Version 1.0](http://bitbucket.org/fbennett/citeproc-js/src/tip/LICENSE).

### Name Parser

The BibTeX name parser's grammar is based on the one found

The original grammar is licensed under GPL v3. It has been
converted to ANTLR and is released here under the Apache License
2.0 by permission of the original author Sylvester Keil.

### BibTeX Converter

The BibTeX to CSL converter is based on the mapping used in
[Docear](http://www.docear.org) as [presented by Joeran Beel](http://www.docear.org/2012/08/08/docear4word-mapping-bibtex-fields-and-types-with-the-citation-style-language).

Docear is released under the GPLv2 but its code
[may also be reused](http://www.docear.org/software/licence/)
